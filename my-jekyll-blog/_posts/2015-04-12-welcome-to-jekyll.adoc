## How To Guide
:icons: font
:stem: latexmath

This is a sample page composed in AsciiDoc.

Jekyll converts articles written in Markdown to HTML.
How to change from the default notation
to AsciiDoc is described in the docs of the
https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[Jekyll plugin].


## General info

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory.
Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes.
You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way
is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates
your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows
the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary
front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea
about how it works.


## Code snippets

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
[source,ruby]
----
require 'asciidoctor' # <1>
html = Asciidoctor.convert_file('sample.adoc',
  :header_footer => true) # <2>
puts html
----
<1> imports the library
<2> reads, parses and renders the file


## Images

An example of the hyperlinked image with caption.

== Math Section

An inline formula: stem:[\sqrt{4} = 2]

A block formula:
[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
\biggl( \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\,dx\biggr)^2 &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2+y^2}\,dx\,dy \cr
  &= \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\infty e^{-r^2}r\,dr\,d\theta \cr
  &= \pi
\end{align}
++++

For more math, see {ppn}[PPN Wiki].
